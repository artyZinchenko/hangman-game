# hangman Game

I'm learning JS and I tried to make this game project work.
Basic game functions like picking a random word from array for the play and guessing letters are working. User has six tries. Basic hagman rules.

There's little to no visual part: only letter buttons and display of correct letters.

Things to fix:
-word list too small
-add some visual representation of tries remaining
-redesign
-add SVG for hangman representation
